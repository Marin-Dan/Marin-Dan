- ⚡ Fun fact:Honey never spoils! Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. The natural properties of honey, such as its low water content and acidic pH, create an environment where bacteria and microorganisms cannot thrive, making it an everlasting sweet treat! 🍯✨
